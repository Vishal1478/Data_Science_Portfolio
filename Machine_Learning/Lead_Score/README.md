# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem Statement:
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.
Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. 
Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted.
It has been said ballpark of lead conversion rate to be around 80%

## Aim:
Finding the potential leads who turns out to be paying customer

## ML model:
Logistic Regression

## Goal of the case study:
Building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. 
A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
