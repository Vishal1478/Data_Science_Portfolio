# Syntactic Analysis: HMMs and Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging

## Problem Statement:

The vanilla Viterbi algorithm results in ~87% accuracy. 
The approx. 13% loss of accuracy was majorly due to the fact that when the algorithm encountered an unknown word (i.e. not present in the training set, such as 'Twitter'), 
it assigned an incorrect tag arbitrarily. 
This is because, for unknown words, the emission probabilities for all candidate tags are 0, so the algorithm arbitrarily chooses (the first) tag.
We need to modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques
 
## Data:
Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset.<br>
The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, 
Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.<br>
Note that using only 12 coarse classes (compared to the 46 fine classes such as NNP, VBD etc.) will make the Viterbi algorithm faster as well.

## Goals:
- Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
- Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
- Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
- List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
